- [Project 4: Microservices with Spring boot 3](https://github.com/anderson92zolis/AliMicroservice): Explore essential concepts such as API Gateway, Config Server, Discovery Server, and hands-on implementation of two real-world microservices, Student and School.
- [Project 5: Microservices architecture](https://github.com/anderson92zolis/microservicesAmigosCode): This project provides a comprehensive overview of the microservices architecture and how to build microservices using various technologies, including Docker, Eureka, OpenFeign, and Zipkin. and implementing of 3 real-world microservices, Clients, Customer, Fraud, Notification and Eureka-server.
- [Project 6: NasaSpaceAppsChallenge](https://github.com/anderson92zolis/NasaSpaceAppsChallenge): We won the hackaton of NasaSpaceAppsChallenge 2023 in Barcelona with our team. The poject about is -> Phytoplankton Adventure is an exciting app that immerses you in the fascinating world of phytoplankton. In this game, you take on the role of a virtual phytoplankton keeper, exploring its growth and learning about its essential role in the oceans. You will also discover how scientists study phytoplankton from space and their impact on the balance of the oceans. his project was created by the Galactic Space Coders team as part of the NASA International Space Apps Challenge, with the aim of educating and raising awareness about the importance of phytoplankton, the oceans and climate change.
- [Project 7: Microservices with Spring Boot](https://github.com/anderson92zolis/MicorserviciosAplicaci-nEscalable): Design and implement several independent microservices that will work together to form a functional system. We will explore key concepts such as modularity, business logic decomposition and communication between microservices. In addition, we will show you how to take advantage of Spring Boot features, such as dependency injection and automatic configuration management, to streamline development and improve the efficiency of your application.
